This SQL Script is designed so any user can download it and run it without error, whether it is the first run or one of many previous executions of the code.  
The SQL File:
-Drops tables (so that second+ time executions succeed with no error of saving over existing tables)
-Adds the tables
-Inserts into the tables data fields (Note: all data is fictitious and used randomly generated names, there are no real people used within this project.)
-Adds queries to answer business questions the administrators of the league would want to answer including: findings which players have no paid dues, determining if all coaches have completed clearances, waivers, or required trainings, how much sponsorship money each team has received, what the current standings in the league are, how often fields are used for maintenance reasons, and others.
