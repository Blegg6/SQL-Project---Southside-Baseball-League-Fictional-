# Southside Baseball League (Fictious) Database System

## This project is a proof of concept in the design and execution of a Database Solution for a business purpose.  It keeps data for Southside Baseball, a fictious youth baseball league located in the state of Maryland.

This database solution aims to showcase how SQL can be used to improve the data collection and analysis processes at any business level.  It automates the process of entering information manually, and answers simulated real business questions a league manager of an actual youth baseball league would need to answer to help the league run efficiently.

This SQL Script is designed so any user can download it and run it without error, whether it is the first run or one of many previous executions of the code.  

The SQL File Included within this repository:

-Drops tables (so that second+ time executions succeed with no error of saving over existing tables)

-Adds the tables

-Inserts into the tables data fields (Note: all data is fictitious and used randomly generated names, there are no real people used within this project.)

-Adds queries to answer business questions the administrators of the league would want to answer including: determining which players have no paid dues, confirming if all coaches have completed clearances, waivers, or required trainings, aggregating how much sponsorship money each team has received, creating a table to show what the current standings in the leagues are, tracking how often fields are used for maintenance reasons, and others.


NOTE: PROJECT WAS PUBLISHED WITH PERMISSION OF THE PROFESSOR OF THE CLASS THIS PROJECT WAS INTENDED FOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND'S ROBERT H. SMITH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS. THE DATA USED WITHIN IS FICTITIOUS AND ANY CONNECTION TO REAL PEOPLE IS COINCIDENCE. REAL PUBLICALLY ACCESSIBLE LOCAL BUSINESS INFORMATION IS USED.
